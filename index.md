# Tony O’Halloran

**AI Researcher | MSc Research Thesis (Yale/EPFL LiGHT)**  
**Mechanistic Interpretability & Humanitarian Healthcare AI**

Welcome to my personal homepage. I’m an AI researcher and consultant, currently completing my MSc research thesis co-hosted by Yale University and the EPFL LiGHT group. My work focuses on:

- **Modular Neural Networks for Large-Scale Humanitarian Datasets with Systematic Missingness**
- **Compression Methods for LLMs, Planning, and Interpretability**
- **Equitable, transparent, and robust AI solutions in healthcare**

My mission is to improve patient care by deploying advanced AI systems that can handle real-world medical challenges—especially in resource-constrained environments.

I’ve influenced healthcare policy with early research on portion sizes in Ireland and presented award-winning work on queuing theory for the Irish healthcare system at the Royal College of Surgeons. Today, I combine these foundational insights with cutting-edge AI research at Yale/EPFL LiGHT, focusing on humanitarian data challenges and mechanistic interpretability in large language models.
