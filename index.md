# Tony O’Halloran

**AI Researcher | MSc Research Thesis (Yale/EPFL LiGHT)**  
**Mechanistic Interpretability & Humanitarian Healthcare AI**

Welcome to my personal homepage. I’m an AI researcher and consultant, currently completing my MSc research thesis co-hosted by Yale University and the EPFL LiGHT group. My work focuses on:

- **Modular Neural Networks for Large-Scale Humanitarian Datasets with Systematic Missingness**
- **Compression Methods for LLMs, Planning, and Interpretability**
- **Ensuring equitable, transparent, and robust AI solutions in healthcare**

My mission is to improve patient care by deploying advanced AI systems that can handle real-world medical challenges—especially in resource-constrained environments.

## About Me

> “MSc Thesis Student with Yale/EPFL LiGHT working on modular neural networks for large-scale humanitarian datasets with systematic missingness with the International Committee of the Red Cross. Other research interests include compression methods for LLMs, planning, and interpretability.”

As a teenager, my statistical analysis on portion sizes influenced national healthcare policy in Ireland. Later, I explored queuing theory to optimize the Irish healthcare system and presented my findings at the Royal College of Surgeons. Today, I integrate these early healthcare insights with cutting-edge AI research at Yale/EPFL LiGHT, focusing on real-world humanitarian data challenges.

## Current & Future Research

**Key-Value Cache Compression (LSH-E):**  
In collaboration with Dr. Tahseen Rabbani, I developed LSH-E, a locality-sensitive hashing-based approach that reduces memory requirements of large language models by up to 70% without sacrificing performance. This innovation, presented at NeurIPS (workshop), enables the deployment of robust AI tools—like LiGHT’s Meditron—in settings where computational resources are limited.

**Mechanistic Interpretability in Healthcare Models:**  
I’m currently investigating how LLMs reason about diagnoses, handle uncertainty, and represent critical medical concepts internally. Understanding these internal representations is a critical step in building models clinicians can trust.

**Upcoming Directions:**  
- Essays on humanitarian AI deployments, interpretability methods, and leveraging modular architectures in low-resource settings.
- Project updates and technical notes to help other researchers apply these techniques.

## Essays & Projects

**In-CiGHTS Seminar Series:**  
I co-organize this seminar series aimed at NGO partners like the WHO and ICRC, bridging academic research with real-world humanitarian efforts. I recently presented on LLM evaluations, initiating discussions on the safe and ethical use of AI in global health.

**KV Cache Compression & Efficiency:**  
Ongoing work will be detailed here, including code snippets, tutorials, and reflections on making advanced AI tools more accessible.

Stay tuned for more essays and publications detailing my research, code, and frameworks for building trustworthy healthcare AI.
